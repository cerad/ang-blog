Made empty directory
added readme.md
added some articles.
github repository and pushed initial commit.

copied empty package.json from ang-seed
deleted scripts and dev dependencies

npm install karma --save-dev
npm install karma-junit-reporter --save-dev
npm install protractor --save-dev
npm install bower --save-dev      # Already have global
npm install shelljs --save-dev    # Probably should be global
npm install gulp --save-dev

In general, I think all of the above could be global but at least it documents the required deps.

copied and emptied bower.json
bower install angular angular-route angular-mocks 

Added gulpfile to copy vendor js to web/js
Added basic index.html

copied karma.conf.js
karma start --single-run

===============================
Installed showdown and gulp-showdown.  Conversion is easy enough.

Tried to install markdown but nothing got installed.
showdown looks a bit newer anyways.
need to learn about how node finds modules.
